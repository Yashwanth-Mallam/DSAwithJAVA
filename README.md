"DSAwithJAVA" is one of the key areas I am focusing on to enhance my programming skills and prepare for a successful career in a leading multinational corporation (MNC). 
Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is critical for excelling in technical interviews and solving real-world challenges efficiently, and Java serves as a powerful 
and versatile language for this purpose.


NOTE:
The solutions I have provided for the problems are correct to the best of my knowledge and understanding. However, 
I highly recommend double-checking them and consulting with someone who has extensive experience in Data Structures and Algorithms, 
particularly in Java, to ensure accuracy and efficiency.


Your feedback or corrections are always welcome, as continuous learning and improvement are part of this journey!
